To enhance the yield of erythromycin, effects of various parameters such as bagasse concentration, organic nitrogen source, inorganic nitrogen source, pH and temperature were analysed. It was found that bagasse can be used as an alternate carbon source in erythromycin production medium. Erythromycin production in the new formulation of bagasse based medium was found to be 512&#x000a0;mg/L which was 28&#x000a0;% higher than glucose based medium. Strain improvement was done by random UV-mutagenesis. When compared to wild type strain, mutant strain showed 40&#x000a0;% higher yield in production medium. Erythromycin potency assay and HPLC analysis were performed to confirm the presence of erythromycin in the partially purified samples.

The production of complex compounds from technically convenient microorganism is an emerging route to the chemical diversity found in the surrounding environment (Jiang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). <italic>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</italic> formerly identified as <italic>Streptomyces erythraeus</italic> is a Gram-positive filamentous bacterium. It is one of the most widely exploited strains for the industrial-scale production of erythromycin A. It is a macrolide antibiotic with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive pathogens (Oliynyk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>). In view of the high clinical importance of erythromycin and its derivatives, extensive efforts have been devoted to increase the erythromycin production by <italic>S. erythraea</italic> which has even been studied as a model system for antibiotic production (McDaniel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2001</xref>; Leadlay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1997</xref>). Meanwhile, erythromycin productivity has also been enhanced by the optimization of fermentation process (El-Enshasy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>; Zou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>). Over the past 50&#x000a0;years, the <italic>S. erythraea</italic> strain improvement has been carried out mainly by multiple rounds of random mutagenesis and selection (Adrio and Demain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>; Carata et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>). Moreover, a series of derivatives of erythromycin, derived by chemical and biotechnological transformation, have been shown to have anti-parasitic, anti-neoplastic, immunosuppressant, neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory and gastro enteric therapeutic activities (Mironov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>). Erythromycin for medication purpose is generally prescribed in stearate form which is effective against <italic>Streptococcal</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcal infections</italic> (Ishii et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1998</xref>). Poultry farms are also dependent on this antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial and <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> infections in cattle. Erythromycin has its subtypes as erythromycin A (Er-A), Er-B, Er-C, Er-D, Er-G, etc., out of these types Er-A is clinically most important and specific. It is used for the synthesis of next generation azithromycin and clarithromycin. Er-B and Er-C are produced as by-products during its synthesis which have serious side effects hence not in use (Zou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). Mutation-based enhancement in production has gained tremendous importance over the last decade. UV radiation studies have come to the forefront owing to their drastic increase in the production rate. As the antibiotic is produced by a cluster of genes, involving several operons (polycistronic), hence there are very little chances of adverse affects in this technique. Recently, double point mutation of rpsL and rsmG gene in <italic>S erythraea</italic> has been done which has lead to a dramatic increase in erythromycin production (Tanaka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>).</p><p>The primary aim of this work was to search for a cheap carbon source which is also readily available to suffice the basic need of a microbe without compromising the quality of the final product, erythromycin. The remarkable carbon source bagasse is a cheap and readily available substrate for the high yield of antibiotic. It laid the foundation for the future course of action which was to optimize substrate (bagasse) concentration at standard temperature and pH for maximum erythromycin production. After keeping the concentration of substrate as constant, other parameters like nitrogen source (organic and inorganic), pH, temperature were optimized to enhance the production of erythromycin, as well mainly focused on economic considerations without undermining the quality. The strain improvement studies were then carried out on the same MTCC 1103 strain so as to increase the production rate further, which has its immense value on the commercial scale. All these studies underwent had a sole purpose of reducing the cost of the primary antibiotic, erythromycin which is indispensable for the creation of future generation antibiotics like azithromycin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Microorganism and inoculum preparation</title><p><italic>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</italic> MTCC 1103 was obtained from the Microbial Type Culture Collection, Chandigarh and maintained in ISP-2 solid medium (Enshasy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>). pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.2 and kept for sterilization. The organism was then inoculated into the sterile medium. The number of spores was counted by spread plate method. A volume of 1&#x000a0;mL of spore suspension (10<sup>10</sup>&#x000a0;spores/mL) was inoculated into 50&#x000a0;mL of seeding medium and incubated at 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 96&#x000a0;h on a rotary shaker at 200&#x000a0;rpm. 5&#x000a0;% seed culture was inoculated into 250&#x000a0;mL of fermentation medium and incubated at 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 11&#x000a0;days on a rotary shaker at 200&#x000a0;rpm (Rostamza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>).

The pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.2 and kept for sterilization. Bagasse was obtained from local shops and washed thoroughly with warm water and sun dried. Dried bagasse was converted into fine powder using a grinder. It was sterilized separately and added to the medium before inoculation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Determination of biomass dry weight</title><p>After 11&#x000a0;days, the production broth was filtered through a Whatman No. 1 filter paper.

Subsequent amount of erythromycin was weighed and dissolved in 1&#x000a0;mL acetonitrile&#x02013;water solution (1:1) and equal volume of concentrated sulphuric acid was added. This mixture was kept for incubation at 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min. After incubation period, absorbance of various concentrations was determined at 480&#x000a0;nm using UV&#x02013;visible spectroscopy. From the obtained values, a standard curve for erythromycin was obtained which was used for estimating unknown concentration of erythromycin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Determination of erythromycin</title><p>After 11&#x000a0;days incubation, the production broth was centrifuged at 10,000&#x000a0;rpm for 20&#x000a0;min at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Then the supernatant was transferred to sterile conical flask and equal volume of chloroform was added to it. Supernatant and chloroform formed two separate phases. The supernatant chloroform mixture was incubated overnight at room temperature on a shaker at 100&#x000a0;rpm. Chloroform was allowed to evaporate and erythromycin was separated. The concentration of erythromycin was then estimated using UV/Vis spectroscopy and compared to the standard curve of erythromycin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>HPLC analysis</title><p>Qualitative estimation of erythromycin was done by HPLC system equipped with a UV detector at 205&#x000a0;nm in C18 column.

From the results it was found out that corn steep liquor was best followed by yeast extract, malt extract, casein and peptone. The effect of organic nitrogen source on erythromycin production and biomass production has been represented in the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b. The other media components were kept constant and 3&#x000a0;% bagasse was used. For corn steep liquor, concentration of erythromycin was found to be 416&#x000a0;mg/L and dry weight of cell biomass as 560&#x000a0;mg/L. In peptone added medium, erythromycin production was as low as 120&#x000a0;mg/L and hence it is least effective for erythromycin production. Yeast extract and malt extract had almost similar erythromycin production rate with 356 and 310&#x000a0;mg/L, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Inorganic nitrogen source</title><p>Inorganic nitrogen source has been found to be more effective than organic nitrogen source for actinomycetes growth. Various ammonium salts were used for optimization of inorganic nitrogen source.

Corn steep liquor was used as an organic nitrogen source and rest of the parameters were kept constant. Ammonium chloride was found to be best followed by ammonium sulphate.

Based on the results, it was concluded that both ammonium chloride and ammonium sulphate can be used effectively as inorganic nitrogen source.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>pH</title><p>pH plays an important role in growth of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> and erythromycin production. During the course of this experiment it was found out that the organism is very sensitive to pH. The effect of pH on erythromycin production and biomass production has been represented in the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d. It was found that biomass was high at pH 7 and slightly higher at pH 7.5. But the erythromycin production rate was high at pH 7. At pH 7, the concentration of erythromycin was found to be 461&#x000a0;mg/L and dry weight of cell biomass as 500&#x000a0;mg/L. From the results, the optimum pH range for the growth of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> was found to be 7&#x02013;7.5 whereas the optimum pH for erythromycin production is 7. Thus very high and low pH affected the erythromycin production rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Temperature</title><p>Like pH, temperature also plays an important role for the growth of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> and erythromycin production. Actinomycetes are sensitive to temperature. Different range of temperature has been selected ranging from 4 to 47&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The effect of temperature on erythromycin production and biomass production has been represented in the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e. The optimum temperature for erythromycin production was found to be 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Highest biomass and erythromycin production was obtained at 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The betterment of growth and erythromycin production was also observed at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Results suggested that optimum temperature for erythromycin production ranges from 25 to 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. At 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, the concentration of erythromycin was found to be 512&#x000a0;mg/L and dry weight of cell biomass as 650&#x000a0;mg/L. These values are obtained after optimizing all the other parameters and thus they indicate maximum erythromycin production and cell biomass dry weight which could be obtained in bagasse based medium.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Strain improvement studies by UV-mutagenesis</title><p>When the <italic>S. erythraea</italic> spore suspension was exposed to UV for less than a minute (10, 20, 30, 40, 50&#x000a0;s), many colonies are observed on the plates.

Different production media are used in the fermentation industry. Molasses has been widely used in the production medium of erythromycin (Enshasy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>). In this research, effect of bagasse on growth of <italic>S. erythraea</italic> MTCC 1103 and erythromycin production was evaluated. The results suggested that bagasse can be effectively used for production of erythromycin. Bagasse concentration has been identified as an important parameter which affects erythromycin production as it was being used as a carbon source instead of glucose. This is the foremost report of bagasse being used for erythromycin production. Lower bagasse concentration could have resulted in low yield and higher concentration can result in lower yield because of substrate inhibition. The optimum bagasse concentration was found to be 3&#x000a0;% (w/v) in comparison to 2&#x000a0;% (w/v) conventionally used (Enshasy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>). Erythromycin production in bagasse based medium was found to be 512&#x000a0;mg/L which was 28&#x000a0;% higher compared to glucose based medium. In molasses-based medium, the antibiotic production reached up to 600&#x000a0;mg/L using <italic>S. erythraea</italic> NCIMB 8594 which is comparable to bagasse based medium. Considering the economy of sources, bagasse was better than glucose. Bagasse is cheaper than glucose and molasses. Higher antibiotic yield was obtained in glucose based medium and comparable yield to molasses-based medium.</p><p>Optimization of media parameters is essential to improve secondary metabolites production. Bagasse concentration was one of the most important parameter, as less concentration would mean compromising the production rate and higher concentration of bagasse can lead to substrate inhibition as seen in case of glucose. This lead to transient repression of antibiotic formation, maximum repression was reported at 20&#x000a0;mg/mL glucose concentration (Escalante et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1982</xref>). The optimum pH and temperature were found to be 7.0 and 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Corn steep liquor was found to be the best organic nitrogen source which corresponds to earlier findings (Enshasy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>). When compared to other salts ammonium chloride was found to be the best inorganic nitrogen source for the production of erythromycin. Earlier studies using molasses-based formulation also showed similar results with ammonium sulphate and ammonium chloride (Enshasy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2007</xref>). The mutated organism showed higher growth rate and erythromycin production when compared to wild type. Earlier study involving <italic>S. erythraea</italic> FL2267 showed 50&#x000a0;% increase in antibiotic production by engineering the methylmalonyl-CoA metabolite node (Reeves et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>). UV-mutagenesis was much easier to perform than metabolic engineering of specific pathways and results are comparable too.</p><p>Several studies were previously reported on <italic>streptomyces</italic> (Sejiny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1991</xref>). The growth kinetics of wild type and mutant <italic>S. erythraea</italic> was compared to the specific growth rate constant. i.e. &#x003bc;<sub>m</sub> is greater than &#x003bc;<sub>w</sub>, and doubling time of mutant was less than the wild type strain, i.e. <italic>t</italic><sub>dm</sub> is lesser than <italic>t</italic><sub>dw</sub>. This indicates that mutant strain grew faster than wild type strain. HPLC profile of the samples confirmed the presence of erythromycin. Earlier studies on HPLC chromatogram of erythromycin indicates that retention time of 5.88&#x000a0;min (Abdulla et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>). Area under the peak for wild type strain using bagasse as carbon source is more than that of wild type using glucose as carbon source and less than the mutant strain. This suggests that erythromycin produced by wild type in bagasse is more than that produced in glucose. Also the erythromycin produced by mutant is greater than wild type in glucose and bagasse which is correlated with our earlier findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The primary aim of the study was to find a new and cheap carbon source for erythromycin production and enhance the production of erythromycin by random UV-mutagenesis of the strain <italic>S. erythraea</italic>. After identifying bagasse as a new carbon source it was important to optimize the process parameters for maximum production of erythromycin. Extensive literature review led to the identification of five process parameters i.e. bagasse concentration, organic nitrogen source, inorganic nitrogen source, pH and temperature. It was found out that sucrose can easily be replaced by bagasse for erythromycin production. Bagasse is cheap and easily available as waste from sugarcane industries. By random UV-mutagenesis studies, a mutant strain was obtained which showed 40&#x000a0;% increase in erythromycin production which is significant. The mutant strain grew faster than the wild type strain. Erythromycin is one of the most important antibiotics used in day-to-day basis and is widely manufactured and used. Thus if it is produced at a cheaper rate it would be good for the society. Further research can include production of erythromycin in bagasse medium using mutant strain and optimizing parameters for enhanced production.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are greatly indebted to Vellore Institute of Technology for the constant encouragement, help and support for extending necessary facilities.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Abdulla HI, Abed H, Abdulla AH, Raad M.
